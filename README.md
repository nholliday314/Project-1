## About the Game
"Guess the Word" is a word puzzle game in which players attempt to identify a hidden word with a limited number of guesses. It's a fun and engaging game that can be played in various formats, including on paper, as a board game, and in this case as a browser-based game.

## Tech Being Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Getting Started
To begin playing, choose and click a letter on the screen. If correct, the letter(s) will populate. If incorrect, those guesses will populate in the "Incorrect letters guessed" section. You can make at most 5 mistakes. Good luck!

## Next Steps
* Create a physical pop-up window for win/lose
* Fix a bug for when the user chooses the same letter more than once
* Add a feature to allow users to type guesses on the keyboard
* Complete the stretch goal of creating the visualization of how many wrong guesses have been made
* Complete the stretch goal of allowing the user to choose a level and category to play by creating a dictionary of words including the category and level of difficulty of that word

## MVP Checklist
* Have a PLAY button
* Include an INFO section for rules on how to play
* Create 4 letter word grid
* Populate letters in the word grid when guessed correctly
* Track letters incorrectly guessed
* Track the count of incorrect guesses
* Have a "Game Over" popup when 4 incorrect guesses are made
* Render on-screen keyboard
  
## Stretch Goals
* Create 3 levels of difficulty based on the length of the word
* Create 4 categories of words to choose from
* Create animation visualizing how many guesses are left
